They include:</p>            <ul class="list">				<li>Door Knobs</li>				<li>Levers</li>				<li>Lock Sets</li>				<li>Hinges</li>				<li>Kick Plates</li>				<li>Door Knockers</li>			</ul>            <img src="images/applications-doorhardware.jpg" width="125" height="100" alt="Hardware" class="photo" />			<p>Brass components with simple geometries (e.g., kick plates, round door knobs) achieve the best finished with <a href="buffingwheels-tangential.php">tangential buffing</a> which allows for faster production and lower-cost buffing consumables &mdash; the buffs and buffing compounds.</p>			<p>Round parts are finished with rotary buffing machines that use multiple buff heads to finish the top and sides of the part. Flat parts are finished on a simple reciprocating table that moves back and forth under a wide buff head. In both instances, the last head or stroke is always the color stroke because it provides a bright, clean finish.</p>			<p>Door levers are commonly made from zinc because their unique shape lends itself to a zinc die cast operation.</p>			<p>Because brass and zinc are prone to oxidation or corrosion, they must be quickly plated or painted to maintain a bright, clean surface. If a part must wait more than 20-24 hours to be plated, it is advisable to add an anti-corrosive agent to the buffing compound. This additive will protect the surface from oxidation for several days to several weeks, depending upon temperature and humidity.</p>        </div><!--col-left-->                <div class="col-right">        <?php include_once ('includes/r-applications.php'); ?>        <?php include_once ('includes/hp-right.php'); ?>	        </div><!--col-right--><?php include_once ('includes/footer.php'); ?>
