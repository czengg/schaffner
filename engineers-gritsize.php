Keeping in mind whatever you put in, you have to take out. If a series of polishing operations is required it is suggested to skip no more than 2 grit sizes between operations.</p>			<p>For example, first operation - 80 grit, second operation - 150 grit. If more than 2 grit sizes are skipped, there may be difficulty in removing grit lines from the first operation.</p>			<p>In matching a flap wheel to an abrasive belt, go 2 to 3 grits coarser on the flap wheel (i.e. to approx. A 120 grit belt, start with a 80 grit flap wheel).</p>            <img src="images/grit-size.jpg" width="417" height="298" alt="Grit Size" />                    </div><!--col-left-->                <div class="col-right">        <?php include_once ('includes/r-engineer.php'); ?>        <?php include_once ('includes/hp-right.php'); ?>	        </div><!--col-right--><?php include_once ('includes/footer.php'); ?>
