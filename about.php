            <h2>Excellence in Metal Finishing Starts &amp; Ends<br /> with Schaffner</h2>
            <img src="images/about.jpg" width="250" height="256" alt="Schaffner" class="photo" />
            
            <p>For more than 60 years, Schaffner Manufacturing Co. has set the standards for developing Flap Wheels, Buffing Wheels and Buffing Compounds for specialized applications across a wide range of industries. In fact, our innovations have resulted in several patents, including ones for stack buffs, cartridge buffs and fire retarding buffs.</p>
            
            <p>From the start, we've always believed there's a strong market for high-quality, customized metal finishing products. That unwavering commitment to quality enabled us to become North America's first buffing compound manufacturer to receive <a href="quality.php">ISO 9002 registration</a>. We've also earned<br /> <a href="quality.php">ISO 9001:2008 certification.</a></p>
            
            <p>When it comes to environmental stewardship, our commitment goes back to 1986. That's when we introduced a materials usage reduction program consisting of bulk packaging for all our products.</p>
            
            <p>Over the years, we've also started several recycling programs to re-use buffing wheel stacks and cartridges, as well develop our MEG-A-VAT&reg; system for easy packaging and storage of buffing compounds. When customers empty their MEG-A-VATs, they return them to us for refills, getting credit for any buffing compound left inside.</p>
            
            <p>Our commitment to excellence is exemplified by our longtime affiliations with a variety of metal finishing associations and related organizations, including:</p>
            <ul class="list">
            	<li>Society of Manufacturing Engineers</li>
                <li>National Association of Metal Finishers</li>
                <li>Coated Abrasive Fabricators Association</li>
                <li>ISO &mdash; International Standards Organization</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>At facilities in Pittsburgh, PA, Jackson, MS, and Northville, MI, the Schaffner team works hard &mdash; and smart &mdash; every day to help our customers shine in their production of automotive &amp; truck parts, motorcycles, aerospace components, plumbing fixtures, decorative hardware and cookware made of aluminum, brass, stainless steel and zinc.</p>
