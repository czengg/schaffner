On the Mohs Scale of Hardness, SiC is 9.5 and tends to fracture under pressure, presenting a new sharp edge to the workpiece. This characteristic causes SiC to be fast-cutting and well-suited to many ferrous materials.</p>        </div><!--col-left-->                <div class="col-right">        <?php include_once ('includes/r-flapwheels.php'); ?>        <?php include_once ('includes/hp-right.php'); ?>	        </div><!--col-right--><?php include_once ('includes/footer.php'); ?>
