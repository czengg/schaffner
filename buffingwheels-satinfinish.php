            <p>Satin Finish Buffing, sometimes called Brushed Finish, has become popular over the past several years. A satin finish may be achieved with a <a href="buffingwheels-cutcolor.php">Cut Buff or Color Buff</a> motion.</p>

			<p>The Cut Buff is more aggressive in removing small scratches and produces a smooth but dull finish. It also leaves a thin compound residue that has the appearance of a haze.</p>

			<p>In contrast, the Color Buff motion is not as aggressive in removing imperfections but produces a shinier, more reflective finish. It also removes most of the compound residue, leaving the part cleaner than the Cut Buff motion. </p>
            
            <p>This buff will produce a satin finish on Ferrous and Non-Ferrous metals. The work is dry, and various degrees of satin finishing can be obtained with one grit size merely by increasing or decreasing the R.P.M. of the lathe. Recommended S.F.M.&mdash;4000.</p>
            
            <p>One buff will cover approximately 1 1/4" of surface &mdash; as many buffs as are needed can be butted together to make up the face width required.</p>
            
            <p>The sections can be assembled on the job into cylindrical form to present a continuous face for finishing or they can be supplied in this form completely assembled for use on operations such as finishing of <em>continuous strip</em>, or <em>without water.</em></p>
            
            <p>They will conform to shapes being run and maintain the formed face as long as like material is being run.</p>
            
            <p>A light pressure is all that is necessary to satin finish a product.</p> 

			<p>Flanges are needed for each s√¨de of the buff assembly. "Sati-Buffs" are loaded onto the shaft in the same manner as a bias-type cloth buff.</p>
