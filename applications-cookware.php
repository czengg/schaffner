Aluminum provides good heat distribution and is often used for less expensive cookware. In contrast, stainless steel has better wear characteristics. The best cookware, however, is made from a multi-ply (clad) material that often has outside layers of stainless steel to provide good wear and a bright appearance, and an interior layer of aluminum to provide even heat distribution for better cooking.</p>			<p>Regardless of exterior material, the simple round shape of most cookware makes it ideal for fast, efficient <a href="buffingwheels-tangential.php">tangential buffing</a>. Although care should be taken to minimize heat building that can occur in tangential buffing, multi-buffing head rotary machines can finish the sides and top simultaneously, helping to avoid the problem. Small product quantities can be buffed on a hand jack using a spinner to cover the sides in a uniform manner.</p>			<p>When buffing cookware, it is important to refrain from applying too much pressure. That's because excess pressure results in the "coffee can effect" from hard buffs (usually sisal) are applied for too long, imparting lines into the part that look like the old coffee cans.</p>			<p>A uniform finish can be achieved by applying moderate pressure on each buff head, sometimes angling (5&deg; to 7&deg;) a few of the buff heads to reduce the coffee can effect.</p>			<p>As with other kinds of tangential buffing, cookware uses the color stroke as the final step to provide a bright, clean surface before the part undergoes final wash and packing.</p>        </div><!--col-left-->                <div class="col-right">        <?php include_once ('includes/r-applications.php'); ?>        <?php include_once ('includes/hp-right.php'); ?>	        </div><!--col-right--><?php include_once ('includes/footer.php'); ?>
