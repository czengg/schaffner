Buffing and polishing can be dangerous occupations, and extreme care should be used when operating any buffing wheel. If a wheel should disengage during use, it could cause serious injury to any unprotected body parts.</p>			<h2>Buffing Wheel Safety Guidelines</h2>			<p>The following are guidelines for the safe operation of buffing wheels, but they are by no means a substitute for common sense. If you have any questions concerning the overall safety of a particular buffing application. Consult your foreman or your safety department.</p>			<ol class="olist">				<li>Be sure that the end flanges of the wheel meet OSHA standards, and that they are of sufficient diameter to extend the outer tip of the teeth in the clinch ring.</li>				<li>Do not use buffing wheel flanges that are either smaller or larger than the outer tips of the teeth in the clinch ring.</li>				<li>The diameter of the buffing wheel shaft should match the diameter of the arbor hole.</li>				<li>Prior to installation of a buffing wheel buff, examine the product for defects or damage.</li>				<li>Carefully mount the buffing wheel, making sure that its tails trail the direction of rotation.</li>				<li>If spaces are used between buff sections, the outside must be large enough to cover the tip of the teeth in the clinch ring. If a spacer supports the buff center, be sure that the support area is the correct diameter, and gives support to the entire inside diameter of the clinch ring.</li>				<li>Make sure that the wheel flange areas of the spacer securely clamp the clinch ring of the buff.<br />				<strong>NOTE: If buffs spin on the hub or spacer, fires or clinch ring breakage may occur.</strong></li>				<li>Excessive or unusual vibration would indicate the need for corrective action. Shut the machine down immediately, determine the cause, and correct the situation.</li>				<li>Never bypass machine manufacturers' recommendations concerning the safe operation procedures.</li>				<li>Use and maintain the dust collection system.</li>				<li>For small and irregular shaped parts, the use of properly designed holding devices is suggested.</li>                <li>Never leave a machine running unattended.</li>            	<li>Never permit clothing, hair, jewelry, or other loose articles to get between the rotating buff wheel and or the work piece fixture.</li>				<li>Always use protective glasses and or face shields as recommended in ANSI Standard Z87.1.</li>				<li>Observe all safety recommendations of your own Safety Engineering Department, the machine manufacturer, and your compound suppliers.</li>				<li>Always use the appropriate body protection devices such as - leather gloves, safety shoes, aprons, safety glasses, hair net or hat, and breathing masks, as warranted by the operation.</li>				<li>Be sure that the thread on arbor shaft is in good condition so the nut can be screwed on freely, and that the threaded portion of the shaft is sufficient to allow firm clamping of buff flanges.</li>				<li>Tighten shaft nut securely with adequate wrench.</li>				<li>Be sure that the nut remains tight. Retighten occasionally if necessary.</li>            </ol>        </div><!--col-left-->                <div class="col-right">        <?php include_once ('includes/r-engineer.php'); ?>        <?php include_once ('includes/hp-right.php'); ?>	        </div><!--col-right--><?php include_once ('includes/footer.php'); ?>
