Flap wheels come in many different shapes and sizes, with outside diameters ranging typically from 4" to 24". The hub holds the flaps together at the periphery and defines the flap wheel's arbor at the center. Flaps are attached to the hub, and to each other, using various materials, the most common one being adhesive or glue.</p>                        <p>The three kinds of hubs used to manufacture flap wheels are:</p>			<ul class="list">            	<li><a href="flapwheels-hubs.php">Metal-Centered Hub</a></li>				<li><a href="flapwheels-hubs.php">Cardboard Core</a></li>				<li><a href="flapwheels-hubs.php">Heavy-Duty Mechanical</a></li>			</ul>                        <p>The flap wheels we manufacture include:</p>            <ul class="list">            	<li><a href="flapwheels-belangerstyle.php">Belanger-Style</a></li>                <li><a href="flapwheels-satinfinish.php">Satin Finish</a></li>                <li><a href="flapwheels-custom.php">Custom</a></li>            </ul>        </div><!--col-left-->                <div class="col-right">        <?php include_once ('includes/r-flapwheels.php'); ?>        <?php include_once ('includes/hp-right.php'); ?>	        </div><!--col-right--><?php include_once ('includes/footer.php'); ?>
