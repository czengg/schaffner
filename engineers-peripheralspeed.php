The measure of this time is determined by the peripheral speed of the buffs or wheels, which in turn furnishes the number of linear feet polished by the face of the wheel within a definite period of time. By knowing the peripheral speed of a wheel, the finisher can establish a formula to determine the necessary unit of time to be set for a given polishing or buffing job.</p>			<p>To determine the peripheral speed of a wheel or the number of linear feet traveled per minute on its outer perimeter (face), multiply the Revolutions Per Minute of the lathe spindle by the circumference of the wheel (in feet). The circumference is the result of diameter times 3.1416. For example, the known R.P.M. of a spindle or the arbor is 8OO. The wheel diameter is 4 inches or 1/3 foot.<br />			Multiply 1/3 x 3.1416 = 1.0472.<br />			Multiply 1.0472 x 800 = 837.16 surface feet per minute. Average peripheral speeds are approximately 7,500 linear feet per minute for buffing.</p>			<p>In order to determine the size of wheel necessary to obtain 9,700 linear feet, divide the peripheral speed or 9,700 by the R.P.M. at spindle or arbor. Then divide that result by 3.1416 which will determine the diameter of the wheel in feet or fractions of feet.</p>			<p>For example, 9,700 divided by 2300 = 4.2173.<br />			Divide 4.2173 by 3.1416 = 1.3424 feet or 16.1 inches.<br />			Therefore, your buffing job calls for a 16 inch diameter wheel. This is important on a constant speed lathe. </p>        </div><!--col-left-->                <div class="col-right">        <?php include_once ('includes/r-engineer.php'); ?>        <?php include_once ('includes/hp-right.php'); ?>	        </div><!--col-right--><?php include_once ('includes/footer.php'); ?>
