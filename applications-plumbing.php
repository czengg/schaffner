With consumer tastes becoming increasingly diverse, there are more product designs and finishes available than ever before.</p> 			<p>Fixtures are often made from brass tubing that has a roughness (grain) generated in the bending process, and which must be removed by buffing. These round or oval parts are ideal for <a href="buffingwheels-mush.php">mush buff</a> applications to wrap around curves.</p>			<p><em>Machined brass</em> parts are often made from bar stock, and buffing machines must remove the fine tool marks before the parts are plated. The simple geometries of these parts make them ideal for faster, tangential buffing processes that use rotary buffing tables.</p>			<p><em>Zinc die cast</em> products are popular for bathroom fixtures and faucet handles because of they can be produced in high volume at low cost. Zinc's thin skin requires the less aggressive <a href="buffingwheels-mush.php">mush buffing</a> process to reduce the chances of buffing through the skin to the porous layer below.</p>			<p>Because brass and zinc are prone to oxidation or corrosion, they must be quickly plated or painted to maintain a bright, clean surface. If a part must wait more than 20-24 hours to be plated, it is advisable to add an anti-corrosive agent to the buffing compound. This additive will protect the surface from oxidation for several days to several weeks, depending upon temperature and humidity.</p>        </div><!--col-left-->                <div class="col-right">        <?php include_once ('includes/r-applications.php'); ?>        <?php include_once ('includes/hp-right.php'); ?>	        </div><!--col-right--><?php include_once ('includes/footer.php'); ?>
