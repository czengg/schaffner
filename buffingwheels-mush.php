It has gained wide acceptance as a cost-effective method to buff items with complex geometries because it prevents the operator from having to continually re-position the part. This process usually employs long buff heads up to 10'-12'. Mush buffs tend to be large-diameter (20"-26") and turn slowly (600-800 rpm).</p>			<p>Large-diameter, slow-speed buffs enable the buffing wheel to conform to the part without causing damage to the part or burning the buff. This method is slower and cooler than Tangential Buffing which is why Mush Buffing requires longer heads.</p>			            <img src="images/mush-buffing2.jpg" width="186"height="200" alt="Mush Buffing" class="photo" />			<p>Often, Mush Buffing requires more compound than a comparable <a href="buffingwheels-tangential.php">tangential buffing</a> application because the part is often buried so deep the rotating buff that the compound is nearly "raked out" of the buff during normal operation.</p>			<p>The long buff heads and slow speeds make Mush Buffing ideal for complex shapes made of non-ferrous materials, including:</p>            <ul class="list">            	<li>Brass</li>                <li>Zinc</li>                <li>Aluminum</li>            </ul>            			<p>These softer materials buff quicker than ferrous materials, so the lower forces in Mush Buffing are ideal. Likewise, the lower temperatures allow the use of poly-cotton mush buffs, resulting in longer buff life and lower operating costs.</p>        </div><!--col-left-->                <div class="col-right">        <?php include_once ('includes/r-buffingwheels.php'); ?>        <?php include_once ('includes/hp-right.php'); ?>	        </div><!--col-right--><?php include_once ('includes/footer.php'); ?>
