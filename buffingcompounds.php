Different kinds of abrasives are used for finishing various materials such as ferrous and non-ferrous metals, plastic and wood. Buffing compounds are made for the two phases of buffing: "cutting down" and "coloring."</p>			<p>The "cutting down" phase is accomplished using compounds that contain aggressive abrasive materials. Applications requiring bright, high-luster finishes undergo a "coloring" buffing process that consists of buffing the surface with a smaller, sometimes less-aggressive, abrasive that brings out the material's natural color.</p>			<p>Schaffner Manufacturing offers a complete line of buffing compounds for any application. Our buffing compound selection includes:</p>            <ul class="list">            	<li><a href="buffingcompounds-liquid.php">Liquid Compounds</a> are the emulsified forms of solid buffing compounds, and are water-soluble.</li>                <li><a href="buffingcompounds-solidbar.php">Solid Bar</a> compounds are used in commercial and industrial applications, and are available in regular and hand-bar sizes.</li>                <li><a href="buffingcompounds-coloring.php">Coloring compounds</a> are available in a wide range of abrasive materials based on the amount of color desired in a chrome buffing operation.
